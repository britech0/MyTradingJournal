# Trading-Journal

# Hello! Welcome to my trading journal project where I created a minimum viable product for tracking the results of stock or cryptocurrency trades.

# PURPOSE: I love trading stocks and thought that a simple trading journal with ability to create, read, update, delete, and note a comment for my past trades would be a great way
# of practicing full stack development on a hobby I enjoy.



# TOOLS USED: JavaScript, Recharts library, React.js, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, HTML, CSS,

# HOW TO USE: (Assuming dependencies are downloaded)
# 1. Frontend and backend are served on ports 3000 and 5000.
# 2. CD into frontend and enter into terminal 'npm start'
# 3. CD into backend and enter into terminal 'npm start
# 4. Check localhost:3000 and you should see the trading journal
# 5. You have the ability to add, edit, and delete trades which will affect the data displayed on the chart by Recharts.


# My Personal Learning:
# I learned how data model schemas, controllers, DOM-manipulation, charting, http requests, routing, react, and general idea how frontend and backend development works
# using the Javascript, express.js, node.js and mongoDB full stack tool kit.
