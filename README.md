# Hello! Welcome to my trading journal project where I created a minimum viable product for tracking the results of stock or cryptocurrency trades. 
#There are some files still in this project since I want to continuously update this project and use it as a playground for testing what I learn!

# PURPOSE: 
#I love trading stocks and thought that a simple trading journal with ability to create, read, update, delete, and note a comment for my past trades would be a great way
of practicing full stack development on a hobby I enjoy.



# TOOLS USED: 
#JavaScript, Recharts library, React.js, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, HTML, CSS,

# HOW TO USE: (Assuming dependencies are downloaded)
#1 You will need to set-up MongoDB and create your own .env for your database.
#2 npm install for backend and frontend
#3. Frontend and backend are served on ports 3000 and 5000.
#4. CD into frontend and enter into terminal 'npm start'
#5. CD into backend and enter into terminal 'npm start
#6. Check localhost:3000 and you should see the trading journal
#7. You have the ability to add, edit, and delete trades which will affect the data displayed on the chart by Recharts.


# My Personal Learning:
#I learned how data model schemas, controllers, DOM-manipulation, charting, http requests, routing, react, and general idea how frontend and backend development works
#using the Javascript, express.js, node.js and mongoDB full stack tool kit.
